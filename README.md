Redis is not only used as database but also as cache server.  Redis is usually compare to RDBMS or SQL Database. In Redis, Read and Write operations are extremely fast because of storing data in primary memory. In RDBMS, Read and Write operations are slow because of storing data in secondary memory. Primary memory is in lesser in size and much expensive than secondary so, Redis cannot store large files or binary data. Note this!

How about using Redis with MongoDB? Both are No SQL database. Is it significant?
